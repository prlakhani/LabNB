**LabNB**

This is my attempt at creating a functional and extensible lab notebook for biomedical research. Online lab notebooks do not suffice for my purposes because I want to combine low-level analysis/visualizations (since I find myself repeating the generation of many of the same figures on a daily basis) with data architecture and management, so I decided that building my own notebook database was the solution. 

The hope is that the various elements of this project inspire others to fork and expand upon my work, and I will hopefully be able to learn something from others' improvements. 

This project relies heavily upon the django-polymorphic models for its flexibility, so MAJOR thanks to chrisglass and their project at [django-polymorphic](https://github.com/chrisglass/django_polymorphic). Please let me know of a better way to credit their work, if anyone has a suggestion. Similarly, Cam Davidson's [lifelines](https://github.com/CamDavidsonPilon/lifelines) package has been a lifeline. 

Sorry about that.
